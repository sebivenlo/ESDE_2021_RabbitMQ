## Exercises

### Explore the RabbitMQ web interface

As mentioned before, together with the docker-container, a web interface has been set up by RabbitMQ. This can be accessed by clicking on the following link:

[RabbitMQ Management UI](http://127.0.0.1:15672/)

The default user credentials for this web interface are as follows:
```
username: guest
password: guest
```

The first exercise is to study the web interface a bit. There is no specific goal set for this exercise, so just explore for *1-5 minutes*.
